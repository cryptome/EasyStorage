# Solidity

Here is a collection of smart contracts written in Solidity. I'm currently using Remix to test these files.

The EasyStorage contract allows us to store a universal favorite number as well as favorite numbers for different people in both mappings and arrays

The EasyStorageLab contract allows us to create smart contracts with stored data, save them into an array, and then run the eslGet function to retrieve data stored within the array's contracts.
